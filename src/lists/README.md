# Lists

A list is a collection of items stored in a particular order. You can make a list that includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits, or the names of all of your coworkers.

In this chapter we will learn how to [create](./creating-lists.md) and [modify](./modifying-lists.md) lists and how to work with the [individual elements](./accessing-elements.md) in a list. We will also learn several useful operations we can perform on lists, such as [sorting](./sorting.md) and [reversing](./reverse.md).
