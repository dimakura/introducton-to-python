# Lists

A list is a collection of items stored in a particular order. You can make a list that includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0–9, or the names of all of your coworkers. You can put anything you want into a list, and the items in your list don’t have to be related in any particular way. Because a list usually contains more than one element, it’s a good idea to make the name of your list plural, such as `letters`, `digits`, or `names`.
