# Creating Lists

To create a list, enclose the elements within square brackets, separated by commas.

For example, let's create a list of weekdays:

File: `days.py`

```py
{{#include ../../listings/lists/days.py:first}}
```

The output looks exactly like the list in the source code. But this is not always the case:

```py
{{#include ../../listings/lists/days.out:1}}
```
