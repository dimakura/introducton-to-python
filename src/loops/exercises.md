## 1. Squares

Ask user to enter five numbers between `1` and `10`. If user enters number outside of that range, print message "Number is not in range". When user enters all five numbers, print squares of all numbers.

## 2. Sum of numbers

Create a list of numbers by asking user to enter numbers. When user enters `"stop"`, stop asking for numbers. Print sum of all numbers in the list. Don't use `sum()` function.

## 3. Factorial

Ask user to enter a number. Print factorial of that number. If user enters number less than `0`, print message "Number is not in range".

_Note_: factorial of `0` is `1`.

## 4. Fibonacci

Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is a sum of two previous numbers. First two numbers are `0` and `1`. For example, first ten numbers in Fibonacci sequence are:

```python
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```

Print first `n` numbers in Fibonacci sequence, where `n` is a number entered by user.
