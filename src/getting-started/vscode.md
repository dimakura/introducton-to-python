# Installing VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.

To install it on your system open the [VS Code home page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer for your operating system (we assume, it's Windows 11).

Run the installer, and follow the on-screen instructions.

Now open WSL and type `code` to launch VS Code. For the first time, it will ask you to install the Remote - WSL extension. Click on the Install button and wait for the installation to complete.

You will need one more extension for Python development. It's called [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and is useful for syntax highlighting and code completion.

One more extension that you might find useful is [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter). It allows you to run Jupyter notebooks inside VS Code. We won't explicitly use it in this course, but you might find it useful in your own explorations.
