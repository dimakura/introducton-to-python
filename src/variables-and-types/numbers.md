# Numbers

In Python we mostly deal with two types of numbers: integers and floating-point numbers.

## Integers

Integers are whole numbers, such as `1`, `2`, `3`, etc. Integers can be positive or negative.

Python supports basic arithmetic operations on integers, such as addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

Tihs is a simple example of using integer operations in Python:

```py
{{#include ../../listings/variables-and-types/integers.py}}
```

which will print:

```txt
{{#include ../../listings/variables-and-types/integers.out}}
```

Note that the division operator (`/`) always returns a floating-point number, even if the result is a whole number.

Few more useful operations on numbers are the exponentiation operator (`**`), the modulo operator (`%`), and the floor division operator (`//`).

## Floating-Point Numbers

Any number with a decimal point is a floating-point number. Python supports the same basic arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers as it does on integers.

As an exercise, try to practice operations on floating-point numbers by modifying the examples above.
