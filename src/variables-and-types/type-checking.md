# Checking Variable Types

If you are not sure what type a variable is, you can ask Python to tell you. For example, if you have a variable called `x`, you can ask Python what type it is by using the `type()` function:

```python
{{#include ../../listings/ch02/typechecking.py}}
```

which will print:

```text
{{#include ../../listings/ch02/typechecking.out}}
```
