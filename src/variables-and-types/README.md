# Variables and Simple Data Types

In this chapter, you will learn about variables and simple data types in Python.
We start our discussion with what a [variable](./variables.md) is.
Then we will learn about [strings](./strings.md) and [numbers](./numbers.md) and how to work with them.
Finally, we will learn about type hints and how to use them in Python.
At the very end you will learn how to better document your code using [comments](./comments.md).
