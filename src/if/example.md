# An Example

The following code shows how to use an `if` statement to check if a person is old enough to vote.

File: `vote.py`:

```py
{{#include ../../listings/if-statement/vote.py}}
```

with result:

```txt
{{#include ../../listings/if-statement/vote.out:1}}
```

We will learn more about `if` statements in this chapter.
